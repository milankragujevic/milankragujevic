Hi ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a 23 year old software engineer from Serbia. I work with mainly web technologies, but also dabble a bit with embedded C, as well as MikroTik networking (wired and wireless), live streaming infrastructure, Linux administration, and a lot of other stuff ðŸ˜Š

Other than my blog at [https://milankragujevic.com](https://milankragujevic.com/) â€” which recently celebrated it's 10 year anniversary ðŸŽ‰ â€” I also run the Serbian telco news portal [TeleSrbija](https://telesrbija.com).
